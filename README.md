## How to run

Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Dmum303/MERNsters-inc.git

```

Run the frontend:

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run start
```

# Project setup

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork to your local machine
3. Install Node.js dependencies for both frontend and backend (API)

   ```
   ; cd backend
   ; npm i
   ; cd ../frontend
   ; npm i
   ```

4. Install MongoDB
   ```
   brew tap mongodb/brew
   brew install mongodb-community@5.0
   ```
5. Start MongoDB
   ```
   brew services start mongodb-community@5.0
   ```

# Running the application

1. Start the server
   ```
   ; cd backend
   ; JWT_SECRET=SUPER_SECRET npm start
   ```
2. Start the front end

In a new terminal session...

```
; cd frontend
; npm run start
```

You should now be able to open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/` which directs you to the hompeage, where you can sign-up or log in.

## Running mongoDB

```shell
   # Start the mongo terminal/REPL
   mongosh
```

## Mongosh commands

```shell
   # Show all databases
   show dbs

   # Switch to a database
   use <database name>

   # Show all collections in the current database
   show collections

   # Show all documents in a collection
   db.<collection name>.find()

   # Show all documents in a collection, formatted
   db.<collection name>.find().pretty()
```

### Testing

#### The Backend (API)

**Note the use of an environment variable for the JWT secret**

Start the server in test mode (so that it connects to the test DB)

Need to question how this starts, currently
; cd into backend
; npm test

```
; cd api
; JWT_SECRET=SUPER_SECRET npm run start:test
```

Then run the tests in a new terminal session

```
; cd api
; JWT_SECRET=SUPER_SECRET npm run test
```
